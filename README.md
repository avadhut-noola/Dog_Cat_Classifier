# CNN Development

This repository contains the work completed during the GenAI Study Jam organized by GDG SCOE.  
The focus of this session was to train a dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), leveraging the power of TensorFlow and its extensive library ecosystem.

# Concepts Covered:
Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Working with TensorFlow libraries like:
Dense  
Conv2D  
MaxPooling2D and more.  
Fundamentals of image classification and deep learning models.  

# Technologies Used:
Python  
TensorFlow  
Keras  

# How to Run:
